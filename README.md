# Cybercrow: Agricultural Survaillance System 
**Description**:
An innovative surveillance system designed to enhance crop protection and monitoring through advanced image capture technology, deep neural networks, and real-time data analysis. The system identifies invasive animals, detects crop diseases, and monitors soil moisture levels, providing timely alerts to farmers and supporting sustainable farming practices.

**Key Features**:
- Invasive animal detection and deterrence
- Crop disease identification
- Soil moisture level monitoring
- Real-time alerts
- Drone integration for enhanced surveillance
- Support for sustainable agriculture

**Future Development Goals**:
- Broader disease detection capabilities
- Integration with weather forecasting
- Advanced data analytics
- Improved user interfaces and mobile app support

This project represents a significant step forward in agricultural technology, aiming to empower farmers with the tools they need to protect their crops and promote sustainable farming practices.
